## How to play

When the game first loads up, you are given a randomly generated Bingo Card with numbers between 1 - 75.

You can draw numbers with the 'Draw a Number' button until your card wins by making 5 matches in a row, column, or diagonal.

You can also restart the game by clicking on 'Refresh Card'. This will generate a new Bingo Card and clear the Drawn Numbers.

You may also make your own Custom Card and Custom Drawn Numbers.
For the Custom Card, you would input a comma separated array of 24 numbers, with index 12 of the array being 'FREE'.

For the Custom Drawn Numbers, you would input a comma separated array of numbers between 1-75.
